                    <p>Hi, I'm Sam! I am a former educator and gardener, current bookseller and student, and future librarian. I'm pursuing a Master's of Library and Information Science at Pratt Institute, and am interested in children's librarianship, GIS/mapping, and reference.
                        I grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, just outside of Washington, DC. I love my home town and have lots of MD and DC pride, but have also been shaped by time spent in western Massachussetts; Street, MD (northeast of Baltimore); southern and southwestern France; and New York!
                        At the moment my main hobbies are browsing Facebook Marketplace for tchotchkes, keeping up my DuoLingo Yiddish streak (1158 days and counting!), and searching for the best gluten-free bagel NYC has to offer. I also love spending time outside, reading, and crafting.
